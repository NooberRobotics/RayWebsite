            <p> The electrical systems of the ray were designed to be modular and replaceable. To do this, we created a circuit rack that allowed us
            to easily remove all of our circuits. The rack was actually made of another circuit board, with female headers as the plug-in points.
            This rack board contained all the power rail, input, and output connections on it, and allowed us to route all of our inputs directly to
            the TINIAH board. </p>

            <p> Two main kinds of circuits were used. H-bridges, to control the drivetrain (right side) and IR processing circuits. The IR processing circuits
                detected the IR light, performed DC blocking, filtered to the right frequency (using a biquad filter), amplified the signal, and rectified it to
                a near DC signal that could be taken as an analog input to the TINAH board.
